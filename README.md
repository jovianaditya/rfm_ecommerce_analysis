# RFM E-commerc Analysis

New e-commerce is not too sure about the purchase behavior of its customers. They want to be familiar with customerâ€™s purchase behavior. Knowing the customer's purchase behavior is important because by knowing it the e-commerce company can apply the right business strategy. In this project to know the customer's purchase behavior RFM analysis will be performed followed by clustering using K-Means algorithm.

Explanation of RFM :

* This data frame is obtained after perform several steps like cleaning, preprocessing, transformation and standardization.


To define the number of cluster will be used for K-Means algorithm several evaluation like elbow method & silhouette chart will be performed :

* From looking the result from evaluation above, it looks k = 3 is the best fit for this project.

Clustering Result 3D View :

Clustering result can be visualize in 2D view because the frequency of each customer is always equal to 1.
